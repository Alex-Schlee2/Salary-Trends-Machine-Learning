Born out of CERN and the University of Cambridge, we are tackling serious medical conditions with a mixture of machine learning and advanced statistical tools. Our team is composed of world experts in deep learning, cardiology, bioinformatics and data science.
Predictive analytics is the next frontier in medicine. Today, patients with chronic medical conditions suffer life-threatening disease complications without warning. Tomorrow, patients and healthcare providers will use Transformative tools to identify subtle physiologic changes that precede symptom onset, enabling personalised preparation and prevention.
Annually, 6 million people die of Sudden Cardiac Arrest. Yet, no available technology warns patients or healthcare providers of an oncoming arrest. We’re changing this. By using world-class AI and analysis techniques from CERN, we’ve developed an algorithm that predicts Sudden Cardiac Arrest, enabling lives to be saved.
RESPONSIBILITIES
In the first instance, your role will primarily involve working with the Transformative team on its ventricular tachyarrhythmia prediction algorithm as it is validated and further developed using a set of ten cardiac databases.
In the long term, your focus will be to create targeted models for well-defined conditions with highly detrimental acute outcomes. As a team, Transformative is developing artificially intelligent predictive monitoring services that avoid complications of a broad range of chronic medical conditions.

causaLens is on a mission to build truly intelligent machines that go beyond current machine learning approaches - a curve-fitting exercise. Devising Causal AI has allowed us to teach machines cause and effect for the first time - a major step towards true AI.
causaLens is run by scientists and engineers, the majority holding a PhD in a quantitative field. For more information visit www.causaLens.com. Follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter.

These 8-week internships provide registered undergraduates with a supervisor, along with access to other research scientists/engineers, unique facilities and the opportunity to participate in ‘hands-on’ research activities. At the end of the summer, and with the assistance of their supervisor, each intern will prepare a poster summarising their research. Poster submissions will be scored through a competitive process; authors of at least the top 20 will be invited to present their research at a poster session at the Faraday Institution Conference in November 2020 (25th or 26th).
Exploring the link between the Madelung potential and disorder in lithium rich cathode materials.
There is a direct correlation between a nations GDP and its energy consumption. Next generation lithium ion batteries will play a critical role in the future of humanity. The UK government committed to ending the sale of petrol and diesel cars in the UK by 2035, with electric cars becoming the new normal. As a result, there is a critical need for science to develop new batteries that are capable of holding charge for long periods of time, that have high safety ratings, long lifespans and contain cheap and abundant materials. This project is part of an £11.4 research project designed to develop next generation Li-ion batteries that can deliver on the promises of a green energy future. The successful candidate will be part of the computational division of the CATMAT project which uses sophisticated computational techniques to discover and predict the properties of new battery materials. You will be tasked with running theoretical calculations using the Faraday Institution’s Supercomputer. The results of these calculations will be used to train a simple machine learning model which will allow us to understand the effect of disorder in cathode materials. The project is directly supervised by Dr Adam R. Symington, in the research groups of the CATMAT principle investigator, Prof. Saiful Islam and the project leader, Dr. Benjamin Morgan at the University of Bath. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 situation, the entire project will be running remotely.
Who we’re looking for:
You will be an undergraduate student in Chemistry, Physics, Materials Science or Computer Science at a UK university. You must have an additional year remaining on your course in order to be eligible. Experience of programming in Python or would be beneficial but not essential.
What you’ll learn
Full training will be provided
You’ll learn to acquire data using the Faraday Institution’s Newly Upgraded Supercomputer, which will develop your Unix skills.
You’ll learn to how to use Python programming in data analysis.
You will be exposed to statistical analysis techniques and machine learning.
We value, promote and celebrate inclusion, challenging discrimination and putting equality, diversity and belonging at the heart of everything we do. We aim to be an inclusive university, where difference is celebrated, respected and encouraged.

55,Internship (8 week placement) Role of cation identity on local order in Li2MOS antiperovskite cathode materials,University of Bath,Bath,£9 an hour,"Faraday Undergraduate Summer Experiences (FUSE) 2020
These 8-week internships provide registered undergraduates with a supervisor, along with access to other research scientists/engineers, unique facilities and the opportunity to participate in ‘hands-on’ research activities. At the end of the summer, and with the assistance of their supervisor, each intern will prepare a poster summarising their research. Poster submissions will be scored through a competitive process; authors of at least the top 20 will be invited to present their research at a poster session at the Faraday Institution Conference in November 2020 (25th or 26th).
Role of cation identity on local order in Li2MOS antiperovskite cathode materials
Next generation lithium ion batteries will play a critical role in our energy future. Both the transition towards electric cars, and the need to put storage at the heart of the electrical grid due to an increasing reliance on renewables necessitate a far greater degree of power storage. In order to meet the challenges of these new & expanded applications not only do we need better batteries, but we also need batteries which use more common materials. Cobalt, which is a fundamental component of conventional lithium ion cathodes, has a geopolitically complex supply line, and too limited an abundance to meet future needs. It is therefore necessary to develop next generation cathode materials. This project aims to explore one family of promising next generation cathode materials, Lithium Transition Metal Oxygen Sulfides. The successful candidate will perform density functional theory calculations on prospective cathode materials, using the Faraday Institution’s Supercomputer. The results of these calculations will then be used to inform a simple machine learning based fitting of a statistical mechanical model of the materials (a cluster expansion), which will allow us to understand the local order in this family of materials.The project is directly supervised by Dr Samuel W. Coles, in the research groups of both Dr Benjamin Morgan, and Prof. Saiful Islam at the University Of Bath and forms a part of the Faraday Institution’s Catmat Project. Due to the COVID-19 situation, the project will be running remotely, it is not envisaged there will be a significant enough change in circumstances for this to be reconsidered.
Who we’re looking for:
You will be an undergraduate student in Chemistry, Physics, Materials Science or Computer Science at a UK university. You must have an additional year remaining on your course in order to be eligible. Some experience in the python would be advantageous.
What you’ll learn
You’ll learn to acquire data from DFT based calculations using the Faraday Insitution’s Supercomputer.
You’ll learn to how python is used in modern computational physical science projects.
You’ll develop core skills in literature appraisal and how to make notes and run 100s of different calculations in an efficient way.
We value, promote and celebrate inclusion, challenging discrimination and putting equality, diversity and belonging at the heart of everything we do. We aim to be an inclusive university, where difference is celebrated, respected and encouraged. We truly believe that diversity of experience, perspectives, and backgrounds will lead to a better environment for our employees and students, so we encourage applications from all genders, backgrounds, and communities, particularly from under-represented groups such as Black and Minority Ethnic (BAME) and disabled people, and value the positive impact that will have on our teams.

It enables full automation of traditionally manual tasks involved in the process of filing claims, and the applications we build in this team enable that capability to be deployed to the real world, acting on claims as they are being processed and inspiring confidence to our users, through great UX and transparency.
The key challenges you will be managing is how to develop a UI/UX journey for car owners that makes them feel comfortable after they have recently met with an accident and how our application can help them file a claim with utmost ease. The process needs to be easy but at the same time needs to gather all information necessary to process the claim using AI. On the other side, another important challenge will be on how to present the AI results in the most useful manner to both the car owner and the claim handler and designing all their human interactions within our applications.

166,Senior ASR Engineer (EU Remote),Techire,London,"£63,000 - £119,000 a year","One of your earliest milestones in life is speech.
From “mama” to “dada”, to screaming down your house to express wants and needs you don’t yet understand. Your voice is what guides you through the world.
But, what if those words don’t come out in the way you see them in your head?
Our world is increasingly driven by voicetech. That means we need our machines to understand our voice commands, and that’s where you come in.
As a senior ASR Engineer, you’ll be developing speech and language processing algorithms to help those with disabilities and speech impairments, allowing their voices to be heard. You won’t just be developing code, you’ll be creating life changing solutions for people with disabilities.
You’ll be working with Voiceitt, a venture-backed AI startup based in Tel Aviv, Israel. Voiceitt have developed unique speech recognition technology to help people who have problems with their speech to communicate and be understood. Their solution empowers people to not just communicate in real time, but also increase independence through being able to communicate with devices such as smart speakers and homes.
Their solution is one of a kind, which means you’ll have the chance to work on something that’s never existed before. Day to day, you’ll develop and implement automatic speech recognition solutions. Including signal processing algorithmic and application modules, as well as machine learning solutions such as deep neural networks.
You’ll explore how impaired voice recognition performance impacts certain individuals, and you’ll be in the position to create transformative solutions. As with any unique solution, it comes with unique challenges, particularly around machine learning algorithm research and engineering.
Ideally, you’ll join as a Team Lead, or you’ll be driven to be quickly promoted into a Lead role.

The Company
causaLens is pioneering a completely new approach to time-series prediction. Its Enterprise Platform is used to transform and optimise businesses that need accurate and robust predictions – including significant businesses in finance, IoT, energy and telecoms. Almost all current machine learning approaches, including AutoML solutions, severely overfit on time-series problems and therefore fail to unlock the true potential of AI for the enterprise. causaLens was founded with the mission to devise Causal AI, which does not overfit, and so provides far more reliable and accurate predictions. The platform also includes capabilities such as autonomous data cleaning and searching, autonomous model discovery and end-to-end streaming productisation.

causaLens is on a mission to build truly intelligent machines that go beyond current machine learning approaches - a curve-fitting exercise. Devising Causal AI has allowed us to teach machines cause and effect for the first time - a major step towards true AI.

causaLens is run by scientists and engineers, the majority holding a PhD in a quantitative field. For more information visit www.causaLens.com or contact us on info@causaLens.com. Follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter.

We Are Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

264,Software Developer,Gear4music Tech,York YO26,"£30,000 - £40,000 a year","Who we are
Gear4music is the largest retailer of musical instruments and equipment in the UK. Launched in 2003 by Chief Executive Officer Andrew Wass, our sales have grown quickly from £12M to £110M in the past 6 years. We’re not stopping there - we grew by more than 40% during the final four months of 2018!
Who we really are
Here in our technical hub, we really care about people. We want you to grow and develop with us in a fully open and supportive environment. We want to hear your ideas and for you to be yourself in an atmosphere that encourages people’s individual personalities to shine.
We pride ourselves on having a real culture here at Gear4music, we’re not an agency, we’re in-house and offer something that’s more than a token couple of beanbags and a PS4 you don’t have time to play. From important things like having a mental health first aider, silly things like our #toast Slack channel, the occasional #movienights to the D&D club we didn’t even know we had!
We’re techy to the core, with hands-on technical management through to board level. We pride ourselves on our flat structure where our directors sit in with the teams and are only a shoulder tap away when you need them. We encourage honest code review feedback, even if you’re critiquing your boss. We host regular knowledge-sharing lunches and have an active tech share channel for news, updates and all the latest releases
Who we’re not
We’re not the kind of people who’ll sell you a job based on gimmicks and recruiter-speak. We know you don’t want to hear how disruptive we are, how unique this opportunity is or how many boundaries we’re pushing.
We’re also not an agency. You’ll have a chance to do your best work here, in a team who recognise that quality matters. You won’t be asked to skip writing tests because the client hasn’t paid for it.
There is no need for you to bring your noise cancelling headphones to drown out the sound of the endless sales calls, because we have an open plan office where you’re only surrounded by like-minded developers.
We truly believe in a healthy work/life balance. Here, our flexible hours allow you to start at a time that suits you, and you’re more likely to be told to go home than to stay late. That means getting home in time to tuck the kids into bed at night or get to that gig you’ve been looking forward to for ages.
We might be a socially active bunch, but if something’s not your bag, there is no forced inclusion. So if those pints down the pub or board game themed socials don’t strike the right chord, you’ve got nothing to worry about.
What we do
Gear4music sell musical instruments and equipment online. Our range includes over 50,000 products from nearly 900 manufacturers. We sell to over 190 countries, across 20 multilingual websites, 9 different currencies, shipping with more than 15 couriers, from 3 hubs in the UK, Germany and Sweden.
Our in-house tech team build and support the completely custom-built platform we use to make all of that possible. The projects you’d work on might include new user-facing features on our website, tweaks to one of our batch order processing systems, a large-scale architecture rework or an integration with a new courier.
Who are you
You are a motivated, flexible and talented engineer who is excited about leading and developing others and enthusiastic about learning new things and challenging themselves. We have opportunities for developers at every level, from junior through to principal developers and technical architects.
You’re not a lone ranger but believe in a joined up and friendly work environment that delivers real projects. You’re someone who takes pride in the things you do and likes to see things from beginning to end. You love the attention to detail and might even say it could be a strength and a weakness. You will champion new technologies when it’s right for the business.
You’ll also need some personality. You’ll get bonus points if you’ve got strong GIF-game, and we’d love to know what you’re into (even if you’re really passionate about a specific brand of water.) We want to hear all your ideas and we want you to tell us what you think.
What we’re looking for
We want to work with like-minded people who set high standards for themselves and the work that they produce. We’d love it if you were passionate about continuous integration, profiling, unit testing or documentation (or all of the above.)
Some of the skills and experience we’re looking for include:
A solid understanding of object-oriented PHP, design patterns, etc.
Interface development with HTML5, SCSS, JavaScript (including frameworks like ReactJS, Bootstrap, jQuery, ExtJS).
Strong MySQL knowledge, working with large & complex schemas.
Production experience with Linux environments, and experience with cloud computing.
Experience building highly scalable and complex distributed systems.
A background in commercial development, most likely on E-Commerce or high volume transactional systems.
An interest in web software performance (from micro-optimisations in PHP code, MySQL schemas and queries through to progressive web.)
Knowledge of or experience with any or all of these technologies: Composer, ElasticSearch, Docker, Ansible, Github, Continuous Integration, PHPUnit, Kubernetes, GCP, xhprof.
Don’t worry if you can’t tick all of these boxes! If you did, you might be exaggerating. We’d like to hear from you if this sounds like the kind of tech stack you’re used to working with.
What we can give you
Other than the benefit of working with such a great bunch of people, we also really value your wellbeing and want to ensure you have a lifestyle that helps you get the best of your work and your free time. We work hard to make sure you have clear objectives and will tailor your progression plan with what youwant and not just what the business needs.
Great pay, which is never late.
A ‘go home’ culture where no one is expecting you to be still in the office past your working hours.
A personal career development plan and regular one to ones.
Twice yearly pay reviews that are not tied to the company’s performance or your current job title.
A Windows, Mac or Linux laptop, and we’ll buy your IDE of choice
Health Assured Employee Assistance Programme, helping you to manage personal issues at work and at home.
A great discount scheme.
A super generous employee referral scheme.

The project relates to new implementations of artificial neural networks and neuromorphic computing principles using multi-core fibres (MCF) and other space division multiplexing technologies for future optical high capacity communication systems. The MCF will act as effective “nodes” of a neural network, where the silica cores will imitate the neurons and synapses, and the signals between nodes (cores) will be transferred through coupling. In particular the project will exploit the effect of nonlinear signal coupling mechanisms to model the nonlinear transfer function of a neuron. Multiple types of interactions between nodes will be also explored to create different architectures of multi-layer neural networks. The successful candidate will aim to optimize the optical field and fiber parameters and various designs of MCF to achieve the best performance. The new system designs will be studied, first, theoretically, and then validated and investigated experimentally.
POST-DIGITAL is looking for candidates with exceptional skills in the areas related to electronic engineering, physical science, nonlinear optics, photonics, applied mathematics and machine learning. Preferred skill requirements include experience of scientific programming, optical waveguide theory and communication theory.

323,Principal DevOps Engineer,Experian,England,NaN,"Company Profile:

Experian is a leading global information services company that unlocks the power of data to create opportunities for consumers, businesses and societies across the world.

During life’s big moments – from buying a home or car, to sending a child to college, to growing a business exponentially by connecting it with new customers – we empower consumers and our clients to manage their data with confidence so they can maximize every opportunity.

We gather, analyse and process data in ways others can’t. We help individuals take financial control and access financial services, businesses make smarter decision and thrive, lenders lend more responsibly, and organizations prevent identity fraud and crime.

For more than 125 years, we’ve helped consumers and clients prosper, and economies and communities flourish – and we’re not done.

Our 17,000 people in 37 countries believe the possibilities for you, and our world, are growing. We’re investing in new technologies, talented people and innovation so we can help create a better tomorrow.
In Decision Analytics we unlock meaning within data to help clients solve problems and drive better decisions and outcomes; is this customer who they claim to be? Can this person afford the loan they’re asking for? Does this person qualify for a service we provide?

Organisations need to answer these sorts of questions hundreds, thousands, even millions of times a day. As well as answering them accurately and consistently, they need to answer them quickly because that’s what their customers expect.

We help our clients do this – minimising the risk to their organisation while delivering the type of customer experience that people expect. We help them to lend effectively, to detect and minimise fraud and to comply with legal requirements. We help them identify new opportunities including more efficient ways to run their business and better ways to cross-sell their products.

We do this by combining our own data with data from our clients and third parties. We then use advanced technologies to organise and analyse this data, turning it into useful, meaningful information which our customers can act on. Our clients can make lending decisions on hundreds of millions of credit applications every year and can also avoid fraud by checking that applicants are who they say they are.

Background:


Experian® Decision Analytics (DA) integrates predictive data and analytics into

The Company

causaLens is pioneering a completely new approach to time-series prediction. Its Enterprise Platform is used to transform and optimise businesses that need accurate and robust predictions – including significant businesses in finance, IoT, energy and telecoms. Almost all current machine learning approaches, including AutoML solutions, severely overfit on time-series problems and therefore fail to unlock the true potential of AI for the enterprise. causaLens was founded with the mission to devise Causal AI, which does not overfit, and so provides far more reliable and accurate predictions. The platform also includes capabilities such as autonomous data cleaning and searching, autonomous model discovery and end-to-end streaming productisation.

causaLens is on a mission to build truly intelligent machines that go beyond current machine learning approaches - a curve-fitting exercise. Devising Causal AI has allowed us to teach machines cause and effect for the first time - a major step towards true AI.

causaLens is run by scientists and engineers, the majority holding a PhD in a quantitative field. For more information visit www.causaLens.com or contact us on info@causaLens.com. Follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter.

Co-supervisor Prof. A.J. Keane
Project description
Modern high value engineering design activities can involve collaboration between many engineers across many departments and perhaps even different countries around the world. In order to produce the best product possible such collaborations should be as seamless as possible thereby reducing risk and rework. The aim of this project is to explore ways in which artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques can aid such collaborations with a particular focus on the exploitation of multiple levels of simulation fidelity. The proposed frameworks will be applied to the design of an aircraft propulsion sub-system (gas turbine, nacelle and pylon) in collaboration with Rolls-Royce Plc.
In this project results from aerodynamic and structural analysis will be adapted to work with a range of data handling and modelling tools. This will permit the full range of engineering analysis methods to be tested in more collaborative settings. Combined with the latest GPU hardware, Deep Learning, Data Mining and Artificial Intelligence methods to support cross site working, the project will provide insights into the next generation of engineering design software.
This project is funded by Rolls-Royce plc as part of their support to the R-R University technology Centre for Computational Engineering at Southampton. In addition to the basic tax free student stipend of £15,141pa, R-R will provide a further tax free stipend increment of £9,000 pa and therefore in line with their graduate recruitment schemes. The stipend will rise in subsequent years. Funding for travel to international conferences will be available.
If you wish to discuss any details of the project informally, please contact Prof Andy Keane, Computational Engineering and Design Research Group, Email: ajk@soton.ac.uk, Tel: +44 (0) 2380 59 2944.

“Alexa find me an internship on the Alexa Knowledge team!”

Our focus in the Alexa Knowledge team combines natural language understanding, acquiring large volumes of structured knowledge, and building autonomous machine reasoning to allow our customers to get answers to their questions in the most natural way possible. We’re part of a huge research and engineering effort on the Amazon Alexa team.

We’ve solved many complex problems to get to where we are today, but there are still plenty of challenges ahead of us, and Alexa is getting smarter every day. The problems we solve in the Alexa Knowledge team in Cambridge help Alexa get smarter by understanding the different ways people talk, by learning more and more facts about the world, by improving her common sense reasoning and by responding in the most natural way possible in multiple languages.

We set out to build Alexa at Amazon because we believe that voice will fundamentally improve the way people will interact with technology, and we wanted to create a computer that could be controlled entirely by your voice.

On the Alexa Knowledge team, we are constantly making Alexa smarter by enabling her to learn about what’s going on in the world. We believe that the information to answer (almost) every question can be found somewhere on the internet, and not just in an encyclopedia. Our goal is to teach Alexa how to read a wider range of texts and expand her Knowledge Graph to learn more about the world.

This will require methods that lie beyond the cutting edge academic and industrial research of today, at internet-level scale. Together with their mentors, interns create novel solutions to research problems. They publish them to top-tier academic conferences and work with the engineers and other scientists on their team to bring them to the millions of customers who use Alexa every day.

Our internships offer exceptional opportunities for you to grow your technical and non-technical skills. From day one, you will receive guidance from experienced scientists who love what they do. You will drive your own learning and development with guidance and coaching from your manager, buddy and colleagues around you. Not to mention a competitive salary and a lot of computing power!

Demonstrable research track record in the form of academic publications;
Experience of working with large datasets.

Amazon is an equal opportunities employer. We believe passionately that employing a diverse workforce is central to our success. We make recruiting decisions based on objective criteria including your experience and skills. We value your passion to discover, invent, simplify and build. We welcome applications from all sections of society irrespective of colour, race, religion or belief, nationality, ethnic or national origin, gender, gender reassignment, sexual orientation, sex, marital status, disability, age or trade union membership.

causaLens is pioneering a completely new approach to time-series prediction. Its Enterprise Platform is used to transform and optimise businesses that need accurate and robust predictions – including significant businesses in finance, IoT, energy and telecoms.

The platform also includes capabilities such as autonomous data cleaning and searching, autonomous model discovery and end-to-end streaming productisation.

causaLens is on a mission to build truly intelligent machines that go beyond current machine learning approaches - a curve-fitting exercise. Devising Causal AI has allowed us to teach machines cause and effect for the first time - a major step towards true AI.

causaLens is run by scientists and engineers, the majority holding a PhD in a quantitative field. For more information visit www.causaLens.com or contact us on info@causaLens.com. Follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter.

You will be responsible for producing a test strategy across the teams and working with the QAs in those other teams to ensure it is consistently implemented across teams.

What does success look like In your first 6 months?
You will have produced a test strategy for the TM/S teams as a whole, and have worked with the other QAs to align the QA roadmap within each team with the overall strategy.
You will have a roadmap defined within your immediate team to develop the testing within that team in line with the overall strategy. This plan will be agreed with the team leader and Product Owner for the team.
You will have introduced appropriate new technologies and ideas into the team to improve our testing regime and ultimately to ensure the quality of the releases we make to customers.

Requirements
We value those who take initiative and pride in their work and contribute to an informal working environment. You will be able to deliver on the points covered above, taking into account the following:
Extensive experience working with relevant test frameworks (Cypress or pytest, but this can change)

Gear4music is the largest retailer of musical instruments and equipment in the UK. Launched in 2003 by Chief Executive Officer Andrew Wass, our sales have grown quickly from £12M to 110M in the past 6 years. We’re not stopping there - we grew by more than 40% during the final four months of 2018!

Who we really are
Here in our technical hub, we really care about people. We want you to grow and develop with us in a fully open and supportive environment. We want to hear your ideas and for you to be yourself in an atmosphere that encourages people’s individual personalities to shine.
We pride ourselves on having a real culture here at Gear4music, we’re not an agency, we’re in-house and offer something that’s more than a token couple of beanbags and a PS4 you don’t have time to play. From important things like having a mental health first aider, silly things like our #toast Slack channel, the occasional movie nights to the D&D club we didn’t even know we had!
We’re techy to the core, with hands-on technical management through to board level. We pride ourselves on our flat structure where our directors sit in with the teams and are only a shoulder tap away when you need them. We encourage honest peer review feedback, even if you’re critiquing your boss. We host regular knowledge-sharing lunches and have an active tech share channel for news, updates and all the latest releases.

Who we’re not
We’re not the kind of people who’ll sell you a job based on gimmicks and recruiter-speak. We know you don’t want to hear how disruptive we are, how unique this opportunity is or how many boundaries we’re pushing.
We’re also not an agency. You’ll have a chance to do your best work here, in a team who recognise that quality matters. You won’t be asked to rush work through because the client hasn’t paid for it to be done properly.
There is no need for you to bring your noise cancelling headphones to drown out the sound of the endless sales calls, because we have an open plan office where you’re only surrounded by like-minded individuals.
We truly believe in a healthy work/life balance. Here, our flexible hours allow you to start at a time that suits you, and you’re more likely to be told to go home than to stay late. That means getting home in time to tuck the kids into bed at night or get to that gig you’ve been looking forward to for ages.
We might be a socially active bunch, but if something’s not your bag, there is no forced inclusion. So if those pints down the pub or board game themed socials don’t strike the right chord, you’ve got nothing to worry about.

What we do
Gear4music sell musical instruments and equipment online. Our range includes over 50,000 products from nearly 900 manufacturers. We sell to over 190 countries, across 20 multilingual websites, 9 different currencies, shipping with more than 15 couriers, from 3 hubs in the UK, Germany and Sweden.
Our in-house tech team build and support the completely custom-built platform we use to make all of that possible. The projects you’d work on might include new user-facing features on our website, tweaks to one of our batch order processing systems, a large-scale architecture rework or an integration with a new courier.

Who are you
We’re looking for a great Platform Security Engineer, who is excited about working in a collaborative environment. You are a motivated, flexible and talented engineer who is enthusiastic about learning new things and challenging themselves.

You’re not a lone ranger but believe in a joined up and friendly work environment that delivers real projects. You’re someone who takes pride in the things you do and likes to see things from beginning to end. You love the attention to detail and might even say it could be a strength and a weakness. You will champion new technologies when it’s right for the business.

You’ll also need some personality. You’ll get bonus points if you’ve got strong GIF-game, and we’d love to know what you’re into (even if you’re really passionate about a specific brand of water.) We want to hear all your ideas and we want you to tell us what you think.

What we’re looking for
As a Platform Security Engineer, you'll be working with our devops, software engineering, architecture and testing teams to ensure a secure and stable platform for the Gear4music website and back-end systems. This will enable:
Secure and resilient platforms and applications
Effective security testing practices
Safe, reliable and robust releases through thorough build-stage testing

You’ll be responsible for:
Ensuring Gear4music platforms, applications and services remain secure, for the company and for our customers.

Providing guidance and mitigation for issues and vulnerabilities identified and prioritising based on risk.
Acting as a central point of contact for developers’ security related questions and issues.
Ensuring security risks, issues, assumptions and decisions are documented and communicated effectively.
Being an additional escalation point for any critical security issues.
Providing training to our DevOps, Development and Testing teams to ensure strong security practices are well understood by everyone.

We want to work with like-minded people who set high standards for themselves and the work that they produce. We’re looking for someone passionate about pen testing, excited by XSS and sassy about security headers. IAM not sure how I got permission for these jokes.
You'll need to be comfortable working with:
Security testing tools such as SQLMap, metasploit, etc.
DevSecOps processes - demonstrating a depth of application security experience in project workflows.
Being capable of planning and managing your own workload to suit multiple project deadlines.
Collaborate and share knowledge with other team members.
Cloud-based Linux environments: Google Cloud Platform, some AWS
Containerisation & Virtualisation: Docker, Kubernetes, AppEngine
Scalable and complex distributed systems
Infrastructure as code with Ansible and Terraform
Primary development languages: PHP, Javascript
Web servers: Apache & Nginx

Don’t worry if you can’t tick all of these boxes! If you did, you might be exaggerating. We’d like to hear from you if this sounds like the kind of tech stack you’re used to working with.

What we can give you
Other than the benefit of working with such a great bunch of people, we also really value your wellbeing and want to ensure you have a lifestyle that helps you get the best of your work and your free time. We work hard to make sure you have clear objectives and will tailor your progression plan with what you want and not just what the business needs.

Gear4music is the largest retailer of musical instruments and equipment in the UK. Launched in 2003 by Chief Executive Officer Andrew Wass, our sales have grown quickly from £12M to £110M in the past 6 years. We’re not stopping there - we grew by more than 37% in the last year alone!
Who we really are
Here in our technical hub, we really care about people. We want you to grow and develop with us in a fully open and supportive environment. We want to hear your ideas and for you to be yourself in an atmosphere that encourages people’s individual personalities to shine.
We pride ourselves on having a real culture here at Gear4music, we’re not an agency, we’re in-house and offer something that’s more than a token couple of beanbags and a PS4 you don’t have time to play. From important things like having a mental health first aider, silly things like our #toast Slack channel, the occasional #movienights to the D&D club we didn’t even know we had!
We’re techy to the core, with hands-on technical management through to board level. We pride ourselves on our flat structure where our directors sit in with the teams and are only a shoulder tap away when you need them. We encourage honest peer review feedback, even if you’re critiquing your boss. We have an active tech share channel for news, updates and all the latest releases.
Who we’re not
We’re not the kind of people who’ll sell you a job based on gimmicks and recruiter-speak. We know you don’t want to hear how disruptive we are, how unique this opportunity is or how many boundaries we’re pushing
We’re also not an agency. You’ll have a chance to do your best work here, in a team who recognise that quality matters. You won’t be asked to rush work through because the client hasn’t paid for it to be done properly.
There is no need for you to bring your noise cancelling headphones to drown out the sound of the endless sales calls, because we have an open plan office where you’re only surrounded by like-minded individuals.
We truly believe in a healthy work/life balance. Here, our flexible hours allow you to start at a time that suits you, and you’re more likely to be told to go home than to stay late. That means getting home in time to tuck the kids into bed at night or get to that gig you’ve been looking forward to for ages.
We might be a socially active bunch, but if something’s not your bag, there is no forced inclusion. So if those pints down the pub or board game themed socials don’t strike the right chord, you’ve got nothing to worry about.
What we do
Gear4music sell musical instruments and equipment online. Our range includes over 50,000 products from nearly 900 manufacturers. We sell to over 190 countries, across 20 multilingual websites, 9 different currencies, shipping with more than 15 couriers, from 3 hubs in the UK, Germany and Sweden.
Our in-house tech team build and support the completely custom-built platform we use to make all of that possible. The projects you’d work on might include new user-facing features on our website, tweaks to one of our batch order processing systems, a large-scale architecture rework or an integration with a new courier.
Who are you
We’re looking for great leaders, who are self-motivated and love to develop others. You are a motivated, flexible and talented engineer who is enthusiastic about learning new things and challenging themselves.
You will:

Hold regular one to ones with all team members to check how they’re getting on, what they’re enjoying, give them an opportunity to highlight any concerns.
Be aware of individual team members’ career aspirations. Work with senior management team to get them there.
Promote a positive, open, communicative attitude and culture within your team.
You will champion new technologies when it’s right for the business.
You’ll also need some personality. You’ll get bonus points if you’ve got strong GIF-game, and we’d love to know what you’re into (even if you’re really passionate about a specific brand of water.) We want to hear all your ideas and we want you to tell us what you think.
What we’re looking for
We want to work with like-minded people who set high standards for themselves and the work that they produce. We’d love it if you were passionate about continuous integration, profiling, unit testing or documentation (or all of the above.)
Some of the skills and experience we’re looking for include:

Don’t worry if you can’t tick all of these boxes! If you did, you might be exaggerating. We’d like to hear from you if this sounds like the kind of tech stack you’re used to working with.
What we can give you
Other than the benefit of working with such a great bunch of people, we also really value your wellbeing and want to ensure you have a lifestyle that helps you get the best of your work and your free time. We work hard to make sure you have clear objectives and will tailor your progression plan with what you want and not just what the business needs.

471,Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET),Bridge International Academies,London,NaN,"Who We Are
Bridge partners with governments, donors, and parents to ensure that every child has access to an education that develops her full potential and creates the foundation for prosperity for the country. We are dedicated to supporting teachers, empowering school leaders, and ensuring every child has the learning support needed to master the national syllabus and have the confidence to succeed in a competitive world. Each of our project or country teams are supported through expertise and programming from additional offices around the world, combining world-leading expertise in core design areas with locally resident leadership and execution. We leverage experts, data, and technology in order to support and scale every aspect of quality education delivery. Bridge managed and supported schools are technology enabled and data driven to ensure accountability in the classroom for both teachers’ performance and children’s learning.
The Bridge model delivers significant learning outcomes at large scale by combining technology and customized learning materials. At Bridge, we believe innovation and technology can transform learning. Our model – which uses technology to deliver thoroughly researched and carefully designed daily lesson guides to teachers in our academies – is proven to increase learning outcomes for children. We are a solutions-driven, implementation-focused organization, using design principles to work in varied and often highly constrained contexts to ensure learning outcomes and positive development for children. Working in regional and national scales is important to us, as empowering entire generations of children with core knowledge, skills, and confidence is what builds the foundation for a peaceful and prosperous future for us all.
Our mission is to provide our pupils with a life-changing education and we believe that every child should have a right to world-class education regardless of her family’s income. Core to our approach is the conviction that every child can learn, as long as the school she attends is committed to her development and puts her needs to learn at the forefront of all decisions. We have seen teachers and children transform and excel in both government and private schools that we support and manage.
We invite you to join this incredible endeavor that is having world-changing impact across multiple continents. You will join a team of dedicated change-makers committed to ensuring that each decision we make keeps a child’s experience of learning as its guiding principle.
Technology
Technology plays a critical role at Bridge in enabling us to provide education at massive scale and low cost – it's one of the key elements that gives us the ability to deliver what no one else can. Tech spans several key functions, from the hardware and software that our academies use to run all aspects of teaching and management, including mobile payments, to the systems that enable our country headquarters to manage massive local operations, to the data backbone that informs all of our strategic and tactical decision making. It’s a lot of custom software development and a lot of back office systems.
We've got a ridiculously ambitious mission at Bridge, and it's a place where passionate technologists have a chance to directly change the world. No kidding.
Software Development Department, Technology Group
The software development department handles all aspects of delivery related to our custom software applications and services - everything that it takes to turn an idea into working software and delivering value to our users. The department is structured into cross-functional, self-organising teams that work together on projects, short and long, alongside product designers and key business stakeholders.
About the Role
We are looking for a full time Software Developer Engineer in Test to join our London-based, cross-functional software development team, which will participate in building the software that powers and improves efficiency to enhance our competitive advantage.The London team will have a special focus on the parts of the system that are more customer facing, experimental, or strategically important. This person should be familiar with design and implementation issues specific to a data driven, highly scalable environments and be able to handle such issues with flexibility and ingenuity. If you’re looking to be a gatekeeper, Bridge will not be right for you. On the other hand, if you’re all about being an enabler of teams, curiosity and innovation, and more than anything, about automation and repeatability, then Bridge might just be your next gig.

The ideal candidate will have a strong customer focus, a proven track record of delivering high-quality products in a continuous delivery environment, and an appreciation for clean and simple code. Bridge especially values “T-shaped” team members – individuals with deep expertise in particular areas, but comfortable working across all parts of the technology stack.

What You Will Do
More than anything, evangelise a culture of automation and repeatability across all our tech teams and departments - and then get your hands dirty working directly with our teams to make it a reality
Establishing testing practices to ensure the functional correctness, usability, scalability, and security of Bridge software
Deliver and manage automated testing tools for the constantly evolving needs of our various software platforms, including a range of web and mobile applications running across a variety of devices
Integrate automated testing tools into build pipelines to promote a culture of continuous delivery
Help resolve “works on my machine” automated testing issues by pairing with our software developers to run down environmental, network, or other complicating factors
Collaborate with business stakeholders to define acceptance criteria for new software projects
Participate in the design and estimation of new software, ensuring testing is not an afterthought
Devise approaches for validating and monitoring off-the-shelf and third-party software
Participate in the design and use of application monitoring tools to reduce mean time to response and to maximise uptime
Advocate strongly for building quality into our software and partner with the development team to establish and implement overall best practices
Provide third-line technical support to in-house users
Collaborate with software and IT Operations teams to design and implement our next generation deployment architecture with scalability in mind - clustering, autoscaling, blue-green deployments
Work with the product and development teams to establish the Bridge International Academies technology direction, including questions of “build vs. buy”
What You Should Have
Bachelor's degree in Computer Science or related degree, with excellent academic performance
3+ years commercial DevOps experience at the enterprise level.
Hands-on experience across at least a couple continuous delivery platforms (e.g. Jenkins, Go.CD, CircleCI, TFS)
Hands-on experience in Infrastructure as Code tools (Puppet, Chef, Ansible, etc.)
Experience in cloud platforms (AWS, Azure), ideally both as IaaS and PaaS
Experience in containerisation (Docker) and containerisation infrastructure (Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, etc.)
Expertise in both Windows and Linux/Ubuntu
A love of command lines. And an appreciation that other people like GUIs and that’s okay, too
Fluency with Bash and PowerShell
A desire to learn new tech stacks and frameworks - if you’ve only got experience in a particular platform and you think that makes it the right answer, Bridge is not right for you
A proactive mindset and comfort working without constant supervision
Flexibility to respond to the changing needs of the business
Ability to prioritise and carry out multiple tasks
Fast learner, energetic, and enthusiastic
You’re also
A detailed doer – You have a track record of getting things done. You’re organized and responsive. You take ownership of every idea you touch and execute it to a fine level of detail, setting targets, engaging others, and doing whatever it takes to get the job done. You can multi-task dozens of such projects at once and never lose sight of the details. Likely, you have some experience in a start-up or other rapid-growth company
A creative problem-solver – Growing any business from scratch comes with massive and constant challenges. On top of that, Bridge works in often fragile, sometimes volatile low-resource communities and with complex government systems. You need to be flexible and ready to get everything done effectively, quickly, and affordably with the materials at hand
A relentless advocate – The children we serve and teachers we empower never leave your mind. You know them, get them, have shared a meal with them (or would be happy to in the future). You would never shrink back from shaking a parent’s hand or picking up a crying child, no matter what the person was wearing or looked like. Every decision you make considers their benefit, experience, and value
A malleable learner – You believe you can always do better. You welcome constructive criticism and provide it freely to others. You know you only get better tomorrow when others point out where you’ve missed things or failed today
A data-driven decision-maker – When making decisions, you don’t rely on your intuition alone. You collect data, you analyze it and make decisions with clear justifications
A curious investigator – You ask why a lot. You don’t just take what you see and accept it. You wonder why it is that way, and are aware that the world we see is created by human choices and actions – and it could be different. You wonder, and see the world as wonderful even when you want to change a part of it that is unjust"

We’re techy to the core, with hands-on technical management through to board level. We pride ourselves on our flat structure where our directors sit in with the teams and are only a shoulder tap away when you need them. We encourage honest code review feedback, even if you’re critiquing your boss. We host regular knowledge-sharing lunches and have an active tech share channel for news, updates and all the latest releases
Who we’re not
We’re not the kind of people who’ll sell you a job based on gimmicks and recruiter-speak. We know you don’t want to hear how disruptive we are, how unique this opportunity is or how many boundaries we’re pushing.
We’re also not an agency. You’ll have a chance to do your best work here, in a team who recognise that quality matters. You won’t be asked to skip writing tests because the client hasn’t paid for it.
There is no need for you to bring your noise cancelling headphones to drown out the sound of the endless sales calls, because we have an open plan office where you’re only surrounded by like-minded developers.
We truly believe in a healthy work/life balance. Here, our flexible hours allow you to start at a time that suits you, and you’re more likely to be told to go home than to stay late. That means getting home in time to tuck the kids into bed at night or get to that gig you’ve been looking forward to for ages.
We might be a socially active bunch, but if something’s not your bag, there is no forced inclusion. So if those pints down the pub or board game themed socials don’t strike the right chord, you’ve got nothing to worry about.
What we do
Gear4music sell musical instruments and equipment online. Our range includes over 50,000 products from nearly 900 manufacturers. We sell to over 190 countries, across 20 multilingual websites, 9 different currencies, shipping with more than 15 couriers, from 3 hubs in the UK, Germany and Sweden.
Our in-house tech team build and support the completely custom-built platform we use to make all of that possible. The projects you’d work on might include new user-facing features on our website, tweaks to one of our batch order processing systems, a large-scale architecture rework or an integration with a new courier.
Who are you
You are a motivated, flexible and talented engineer who is excited about leading and developing others and enthusiastic about learning new things and challenging themselves. We have opportunities for developers at every level, from junior through to principal developers and technical architects.
You’re not a lone ranger but believe in a joined up and friendly work environment that delivers real projects. You’re someone who takes pride in the things you do and likes to see things from beginning to end. You love the attention to detail and might even say it could be a strength and a weakness. You will champion new technologies when it’s right for the business.
You’ll also need some personality. You’ll get bonus points if you’ve got strong GIF-game, and we’d love to know what you’re into (even if you’re really passionate about a specific brand of water.) We want to hear all your ideas and we want you to tell us what you think.
What we’re looking for
We want to work with like-minded people who set high standards for themselves and the work that they produce. We’d love it if you were passionate about continuous integration, profiling, unit testing or documentation (or all of the above.)
Some of the skills and experience we’re looking for include:
A solid understanding of object-oriented PHP, design patterns, etc.
Interface development with HTML5, SCSS, JavaScript (including frameworks like ReactJS, Bootstrap, jQuery, ExtJS).
Strong MySQL knowledge, working with large & complex schemas.
Production experience with Linux environments, and experience with cloud computing.
Experience building highly scalable and complex distributed systems.
A background in commercial development, most likely on E-Commerce or high volume transactional systems.
An interest in web software performance (from micro-optimisations in PHP code, MySQL schemas and queries through to progressive web.)
Knowledge of or experience with any or all of these technologies: Composer, ElasticSearch, Docker, Ansible, Github, Continuous Integration, PHPUnit, Kubernetes, GCP, xhprof.
Don’t worry if you can’t tick all of these boxes! If you did, you might be exaggerating. We’d like to hear from you if this sounds like the kind of tech stack you’re used to working with.
What we can give you
Other than the benefit of working with such a great bunch of people, we also really value your wellbeing and want to ensure you have a lifestyle that helps you get the best of your work and your free time. We work hard to make sure you have clear objectives and will tailor your progression plan with what you want and not just what the business needs.
Great pay, which is never late.
A ‘go home’ culture where no one is expecting you to be still in the office past your working hours.
A personal career development plan and regular one to ones.
Twice yearly pay reviews that are not tied to the company’s performance or your current job title.
A Windows, Mac or Linux laptop, and we’ll buy your IDE of choice
Health Assured Employee Assistance Programme, helping you to manage personal issues at work and at home.
A great discount scheme.
A super generous employee referral scheme.
Flexible working hours and no dress code.
Company lunches and social events.
Plus all the usual things you’d expect:
Share grant scheme.
Employer pension scheme.
Eyecare vouchers.
Cycle to work scheme.
A great coffee machine and a regular supply of milk."

This role will expand your abilities through working alongside our wealth of specialist data scientists and software engineers on various projects, from rapidly prototyped research right through to high grade enterprise systems.

Roke delivers advanced research, development services and products and is a vendor neutral supplier picking the most appropriate technologies to achieve the required performance and capabilities. Roke staffs its teams with the most appropriate individuals, although it's rare to have nothing new to learn on a project so an enthusiasm to learn and adapt to new technical challenges is vital for this role.

Many of our projects are highly creative, so we are looking for individuals who have the ability to think around and propose solutions to problems. All our data scientists need to communicate to a high standard and work effectively in multi-skilled teams, so good written and verbal communication skills are fundamental.

Applicants who would prefer more flexible working arrangements, such as reduced hours, would be welcome to apply for this role.

What will your role look like?
You will be developing data science solutions within one or more of our client side teams. If you have the experience, you could also provide technical leadership to junior members of staff and interact with stakeholders during the development cycle.
Our data analytics work encompasses all types of data, including structured and unstructured data (such as text and image). Projects vary greatly depending on the customer and their requirements. We use a variety of software, picking the best approach to suit the customers' needs. For example, you might exploit your software expertise to solve big data or data streaming challenges using open source technologies. Alternatively, you might use your statistical background to develop machine learned models to classify data. Or, perhaps you will specialise in data visualisation techniques in order to enable our customers to easily access the required information from their data.
Most projects will require some data cleansing and transformation, so you should be comfortable with standard data pre-processing techniques.
Location can vary and should your role require you to attend client sites, you will be encouraged to spend a proportion of your time at our Roke base site (London) contributing to the Rokes technical innovation and data science community.

What do we need from you?

You will ideally hold a degree qualification in computer science, software engineering, data science, mathematics, physics or similar. Alternatively you will have similar experience/education to an equivalent level. You will be an enthusiastic software engineer and will also have experience of multiple programming languages with a passion for high-quality, eligible and maintainable code.
You will have data science expertise; however, as this is such a broad area we would consider experience in a subset of any of the following:
Large scale ('big data') data ecosystems, cloud infrastructure and analytic frameworks.
Machine learning and Deep Neural Net technologies
Techniques and toolkits for data cleansing, data preparation, data processing, fusion and analysis
Techniques and toolkits for combining data or analysing data streams in real time
Programming languages and techniques for visualising data
You will be comfortable working side by side with product managers, designers, and clients, making decisions together in order to quickly deliver valuable working software to clients and their users.
You enjoy growing your skills and those of your team and you regularly learn about new technologies. Most importantly, you judge your achievements by the success and happiness of your team and its customers.
As an effective communicator you will have experience consulting or teaching and enjoy mentoring junior developers, helping them push their boundaries and abilities. You value transparency and continuous improvement in your development team.
Roke also operates in the fields of network communications, network connectivity, autonomy and cyber and your familiarity with underpinning concepts in one or more of these areas would be beneficial.
Why should you work with us?
We offer you a competitive salary and benefits package including:
A substantial performance related bonus scheme, which we accompany with a clearly defined and fair review process.
25 days holiday per annum with the option to accrue up to a further 8 days flexi-leave.
Company funded private medical insurance, for you and your family, in addition to a contributory pension that will allow you to effectively save for the future.

Senior Data Scientist
Reading or Harpenden · Full Time
Role Description and Person Specification:
As a Senior Data Scientist, reporting to a Data Science Team Leader, you will join a team with a mix of backgrounds in complex domains like agrifood and life sciences, with skills across computing and statistics. You will develop analytical capabilities, predictive models and data processing pipelines that embed analytics and insights into our, and our customers', daily operations.
About Agrimetrics
Mission
Agrimetrics is funded by UK Government to catalyse the whole UK agrifood industry through the power of big data and advanced analytics.

The agrifood sector faces critical challenges: how do farmers sustainably intensify agricultural production to produce more from less; and how do all players manage risk and build resilience in increasingly fragile, international supply chains?

Whilst the industry collects plenty of data, these datasets are often not electronic or are trapped in siloes within disjointed research, corporate or farm management databases. The sector remains very immature in deriving valuable insights through sharing and integrating data and using machine learning applied across large quantities of data for modelling and predictive analytics.
Products, services and customers
Agrimetrics is creating the world's first Data Marketplace for the agrifood sector. This is underpinned by a knowledge graph linking open and private data relevant to farming. Our first product set – Field Explorer – links these data to field polygons that were developed by applying AI algorithms to earth observation (EO)/satellite data.

Customers include:


Third party application developers like Glas Data, who connect with the Data Marketplace through REST and GraphQL APIs and can build their own farmer-facing applications using our trusted data.
Corporate data scientists like Barfoots, who can use our data in combination with their own data from farming operations within analytics that answer key business questions, like predicting when a crop will be ready for harvest.
Academics and researchers like the pan-Europe SmartCow programme, who collaborate around shared and linked data resources to improve reusability and repurposing of research data.

Future data products and services will allow different types of companies across the agrifood supply chain (agri-supply/agri-techs, agronomists, farmers, processors, distributors, retailers) to explore more data, examine data flexibly through different concepts and lenses, and use our Data Marketplace as the go-to resource for exposing their own data and models for exploitation across the market.
Funding
Agrimetrics operates as a start-up – the vast majority of our development and data science efforts are novel and qualify for R&D tax credits. But we are not beholden to fickle investment funding rounds, and Agrimetrics has a clear runway based on grant funding agreements from Innovate UK [1] . Agrimetrics is structured as a ""private company limited by guarantee without share capital"", so does not answer to shareholders.

Locations
We are located at Rothamsted Campus in Harpenden, Herts, AL5 2JQ and at the Reading Enterprise Centre in Reading, Berks, RG6 6BU. Roles are based at either location.

The Company
causaLens is pioneering a completely new approach to time-series prediction. Its Enterprise Platform is used to transform and optimise businesses that need accurate and robust predictions – including significant businesses in finance, IoT, energy and telecoms. Almost all current machine learning approaches, including AutoML solutions, severely overfit on time-series problems and therefore fail to unlock the true potential of AI for the enterprise. causaLens was founded with the mission to devise Causal AI, which does not overfit, and so provides far more reliable and accurate predictions. The platform also includes capabilities such as autonomous data cleaning and searching, autonomous model discovery and end-to-end streaming productisation.

causaLens is on a mission to build truly intelligent machines that go beyond current machine learning approaches - a curve-fitting exercise. Devising Causal AI has allowed us to teach machines cause and effect for the first time - a major step towards true AI.

causaLens is run by scientists and engineers, the majority holding a PhD in a quantitative field. For more information visit www.causaLens.com or contact us on info@causaLens.com. Follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter.

524,Platform Security Engineer (DevSecOps),Gear4music Tech,Manchester M1,NaN,"Who we are
Gear4music is the largest retailer of musical instruments and equipment in the UK. Launched in 2003 by Chief Executive Officer Andrew Wass, our sales have grown quickly from £12M to 110M in the past 6 years. We’re not stopping there - we grew by more than 40% during the final four months of 2018!
Who we really are
Here in our technical hub, we really care about people. We want you to grow and develop with us in a fully open and supportive environment. We want to hear your ideas and for you to be yourself in an atmosphere that encourages people’s individual personalities to shine.
We pride ourselves on having a real culture here at Gear4music, we’re not an agency, we’re in-house and offer something that’s more than a token couple of beanbags and a PS4 you don’t have time to play. From important things like having a mental health first aider, silly things like our #toast Slack channel, the occasional movie nights to the D&D club we didn’t even know we had!
We’re techy to the core, with hands-on technical management through to board level. We pride ourselves on our flat structure where our directors sit in with the teams and are only a shoulder tap away when you need them. We encourage honest peer review feedback, even if you’re critiquing your boss. We host regular knowledge-sharing lunches and have an active tech share channel for news, updates and all the latest releases.
Who we’re not
We’re not the kind of people who’ll sell you a job based on gimmicks and recruiter-speak. We know you don’t want to hear how disruptive we are, how unique this opportunity is or how many boundaries we’re pushing.
We’re also not an agency. You’ll have a chance to do your best work here, in a team who recognise that quality matters. You won’t be asked to rush work through because the client hasn’t paid for it to be done properly.
There is no need for you to bring your noise cancelling headphones to drown out the sound of the endless sales calls, because we have an open plan office where you’re only surrounded by like-minded individuals.
We truly believe in a healthy work/life balance. Here, our flexible hours allow you to start at a time that suits you, and you’re more likely to be told to go home than to stay late. That means getting home in time to tuck the kids into bed at night or get to that gig you’ve been looking forward to for ages.
We might be a socially active bunch, but if something’s not your bag, there is no forced inclusion. So if those pints down the pub or board game themed socials don’t strike the right chord, you’ve got nothing to worry about.
What we do
Gear4music sell musical instruments and equipment online. Our range includes over 50,000 products from nearly 900 manufacturers. We sell to over 190 countries, across 20 multilingual websites, 9 different currencies, shipping with more than 15 couriers, from 3 hubs in the UK, Germany and Sweden.
Our in-house tech team build and support the completely custom-built platform we use to make all of that possible. The projects you’d work on might include new user-facing features on our website, tweaks to one of our batch order processing systems, a large-scale architecture rework or an integration with a new courier.
Who are you
We’re looking for a great Platform Security Engineer, who is excited about working in a collaborative environment. You are a motivated, flexible and talented engineer who is enthusiastic about learning new things and challenging themselves.
You’re not a lone ranger but believe in a joined up and friendly work environment that delivers real projects. You’re someone who takes pride in the things you do and likes to see things from beginning to end. You love the attention to detail and might even say it could be a strength and a weakness. You will champion new technologies when it’s right for the business.
You’ll also need some personality. You’ll get bonus points if you’ve got strong GIF-game, and we’d love to know what you’re into (even if you’re really passionate about a specific brand of water.) We want to hear all your ideas and we want you to tell us what you think.
What we’re looking for
As a Platform Security Engineer, you'll be working with our devops, software engineering, architecture and testing teams to ensure a secure and stable platform for the Gear4music website and back-end systems. This will enable:
Secure and resilient platforms and applications
Effective security testing practices
Safe, reliable and robust releases through thorough build-stage testing
You’ll be responsible for:

Acting as a central point of contact for developers’ security related questions and issues.
Ensuring security risks, issues, assumptions and decisions are documented and communicated effectively.
Being an additional escalation point for any critical security issues.
Providing training to our DevOps, Development and Testing teams to ensure strong security practices are well understood by everyone.
We want to work with like-minded people who set high standards for themselves and the work that they produce. We’re looking for someone passionate about pen testing, excited by XSS and sassy about security headers. IAM not sure how I got permission for these jokes.
You'll need to be comfortable working with:
Security testing tools such as SQLMap, metasploit, etc.
DevSecOps processes - demonstrating a depth of application security experience in project workflows.
Being capable of planning and managing your own workload to suit multiple project deadlines.
Collaborate and share knowledge with other team members.

You will work with our diverse team of scientists, mathematicians, and software engineers, and the executive team. Together, we will use the unprecedented insights we generate from our machine learning technology and the world's largest dataset of its kind, to help our joint venture partner underwrite and price a new category of insurance product in the construction industry. By doing this, you will play a massive role in reshaping the way risk and uncertainty is managed on major projects around the world.
The majority of large-scale construction projects are critically delayed, which comes with a huge financial cost: approx. $2T globally in lost productivity every year. So why do these critical delays consistently occur? Put simply, it is incredibly difficult to correctly estimate the duration of future activities. At nPlan, we're learning how the world was built and we're actively using that knowledge to help current and future projects to be delivered on time. We're fundamentally rewiring how the construction industry operates and our customers (contractors, developers, governments, insurers, and banks) are incredibly excited about what the world will look like, thanks to our technology.

The platform also includes capabilities such as autonomous data cleaning and searching, autonomous model discovery and end-to-end streaming productisation.

causaLens is on a mission to build truly intelligent machines that go beyond current machine learning approaches - a curve-fitting exercise. Devising Causal AI has allowed us to teach machines cause and effect for the first time - a major step towards true AI.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

589,Bioinformatics Data Manager,Genestack Ltd,Cambridge,NaN,"Genestack's mission is to accelerate health discoveries by harnessing the explosive growth of biomedical data. As the core currency of the future, organisations need to manage data effectively in order to remain competitive. Founded in 2012 in Cambridge, UK, our product, the Omics Data Manager (ODM), is now transforming how scientists collaboratively work with multi-omics data, for drug development, crop improvement, and others.
One of the most urgent needs in data management is to source, organise and prepare “clean” data in a data management system like ODM, so the data are ready for consumption by bioinformatics data scientists to perform analyses on drug target validity or biomarker discovery, as well as by artificial intelligence/machine-learning (AI/ML) algorithms as good quality training sets. The bio and agri-industries are starting to be aware of the prerequisite of having good-quality data, to avoid spurious results in downstream scientific discoveries.
If you are a data manager with a biology background, and are eager to make this prerequisite a reality as soon as possible for data scientists at Genestack and our ODM customers, we want to hear from you.
Your goals
Source, import and maintain high-quality data in ODM by performing data extract-transform-load (ETL) functions:
retrieving data regularly from large public repositories or ad hoc from individual high-profile projects,
creating, running, adapting and maintaining data transformation Python scripts,
loading the transformed data into ODM by running existing data loading code.
Collaborate closely with Genestack data scientists by preparing “clean” data, allowing your colleagues to focus on tasks such as performing statistical analyses on the data.
Maintain and update existing ontologies/vocabularies/dictionaries and auxiliary data (e.g. reference genome sequences) to ensure interoperability of the data.
Develop and grow business relationships with our customers' data managers and/or engineers by providing expert advice on how to prepare “clean” data, so our customers can get the maximum value out of ODM.




Required technical competencies
You are proficient in ingesting, persisting and exporting large volumes of biological omics data and metadata from disparate sources using common file transfer protocols (e.g. HTTP, FTP) and RESTful APIs.
You have domain knowledge about omics data captured in common data formats (e.g. GFF, GCT, VCF, FASTA, FASTQ, BAM)
You have used or constructed controlled vocabularies/ontologies, and are familiar with the related file formats (e.g. OWL, OBO, SKOS).
You are proficient in writing bespoke scripts in Python for wrangling and transforming data from a source into required formats.
You pay a lot of attention to details to ensure subtle differences or discrepancies in data are not overlooked.
You understand how auxiliary/reference data (e.g. reference genome sequences) are used in the analysis and interpretation of omics data.
You understand what a ""data model"" is and, using your omics domain knowledge, can make recommendations to Genestack software engineers/architects on its design.
Desirable technical background
You are familiar with biological and/or clinical data standards and formats
You have worked in a biology R&D laboratory in academia or industry setting.
You have a basic understanding of how data search platforms work, e.g. Solr.



Desirable personal qualities
You are a passionate ambassador for good-quality, well-managed data that markedly improves the precision of R&D discoveries by our customers.
You take pride in working persistently with a high volume of messy data, a task often resented by some scientists as being mundane, while under time pressures for business needs.
You are a competent communicator, both verbally and in writing, who enjoys working in cross-functional teams both in Genestack and with our customers.
You are proactive in flagging and mitigating any risks which can spoil our customers' ODM experience.
Your career growth at Genestack
As a fast-growing company in the exciting intersection of big data, technology, and genomics, you will be:
Enabling data-driven transformation for leading life sciences organisations.
Supported by professional training and mentoring schemes.
Trusted with plenty of pivotal opportunities and responsibilities.
Building a diverse and far-reaching professional network.
Well-compensated with company-performance bonuses, health services, and above-rate pension contribution.
If you feel that this excites you and you meet these criteria, we would love to hear from you!
Location: Cambridge, UK.
Level of experience: Both junior and mid-level data managers are considered.
Minimum requirement: A degree in bioinformatics or equivalent professional experience.
We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company.

“Alexa find me a job on the Alexa Knowledge team!”

Our focus in the Alexa Knowledge team combines natural language understanding, acquiring large volumes of structured knowledge, and building autonomous machine reasoning to allow our customers to get answers to their questions in the most natural way possible. We’re part of a huge research and engineering effort on the Amazon Alexa team.

We’ve solved many complex problems to get to where we are today, but there are still plenty of challenges ahead of us, and Alexa is getting smarter every day. The problems we solve in the Alexa Knowledge team in Cambridge help Alexa get smarter by understanding the different ways people talk, by learning more and more facts about the world, by improving her common sense reasoning and by responding in the most natural way possible in multiple languages. We set out to build Alexa at Amazon because we believe that voice will fundamentally improve the way people will interact with technology, and we wanted to create a computer that could be controlled entirely by your voice.

On the Alexa Knowledge team, we are constantly making Alexa smarter by enabling her to learn about what’s going on in the world. We use many different techniques to enable learning and reasoning across a range of structured and unstructured data. We are constantly at the forefront of both research and engineering in understanding user demands and data sources, to extract the right knowledge, expand the range of, and how, Alexa accesses information – all to improve Alexa and give users the best experience. We believe that the information to answer (almost) every question can be found somewhere on the internet, and not just in an encyclopedia. Our goal is to teach Alexa how to autonomously consume a wider range of texts and expand her Knowledge Graph to learn more about the world.

As a senior software development engineer in the team, you will lead the teams technical charter, inventing, designing and building software in ambiguous and complex domains. You take ownership of team architecture, providing a system-wide view and design guidance, making things simpler and driving engineering best practices and will proactively and independently work to improve the consistency and integration across teams, with limited guidance, exploring re-use or extending existing solutions. You understand the business impact of your systems and show good judgment when making technical trade-offs between your team’s short-term business or operational needs and long-term technology needs. You are a key influencer in team strategy, and you drive mindful discussions with customers and peers. You bring perspective and provide context for current technology choices and guide future technology choices. You work to resolve the root cause of endemic problems including areas where your team limits the innovation of other teams (bottlenecks). You will deliver solutions at scale, as you work with multiple functional teams from asset acquisition, product and design, and delivery teams. We have strong links with many teams within the Alexa organization who are all running fast to make Alexa better and you will keep us ahead of those dependencies. You will actively participate in the hiring and developing of others, providing technical assessments for engineering promotions and contributing to professional development of colleagues.

Experience with distributed systems and relational/non-relational databases.
Experience with Big Data tools (e.g. Spark or Hadoop) and at least one functional language (e.g. Scala).

Gear4music is the largest retailer of musical instruments and equipment in the UK. Launched in 2003 by Chief Executive Officer Andrew Wass, our sales have grown quickly from £12M to 110M in the past 6 years. We’re not stopping there - we grew by more than 40% during the final four months of 2018!
Who we really are
Here in our technical hub, we really care about people. We want you to grow and develop with us in a fully open and supportive environment. We want to hear your ideas and for you to be yourself in an atmosphere that encourages people’s individual personalities to shine.
We pride ourselves on having a real culture here at Gear4music, we’re not an agency, we’re in-house and offer something that’s more than a token couple of beanbags and a PS4 you don’t have time to play.

We’re techy to the core, with hands-on technical management through to board level. We pride ourselves on our flat structure where our directors sit in with the teams and are only a shoulder tap away when you need them. We encourage honest peer review feedback, even if you’re critiquing your boss. We host regular knowledge-sharing lunches and have an active tech share channel for news, updates and all the latest releases.
Who we're not
We’re not the kind of people who’ll sell you a job based on gimmicks and recruiter-speak. We know you don’t want to hear how disruptive we are, how unique this opportunity is or how many boundaries we’re pushing.
We’re also not an agency. You’ll have a chance to do your best work here, in a team who recognise that quality matters. You won’t be asked to rush work through because the client hasn’t paid for it to be done properly.
There is no need for you to bring your noise cancelling headphones to drown out the sound of the endless sales calls, because we have an open plan office where you’re only surrounded by like-minded individuals.
We truly believe in a healthy work/life balance. Here, our flexible hours allow you to start at a time that suits you, and you’re more likely to be told to go home than to stay late. That means getting home in time to tuck the kids into bed at night or get to that gig you’ve been looking forward to for ages.

You will champion new technologies when it’s right for the business.
You’ll also need some personality. You’ll get bonus points if you’ve got strong GIF-game, and we’d love to know what you’re into (even if you’re really passionate about a specific brand of water.) We want to hear all your ideas and we want you to tell us what you think.

665,Senior Data Engineer,REalyse,London,NaN,"Senior Data Engineer
Experience 5-10 years
REalyse is seeking a smart, self-motivated Senior Data Engineer to join our great and growing development team. This will be very much a technical development role, with a special focus on data.
About you
You care about getting the best possible outcome, you have a passion for what you do which you can clearly convey by your actions.
You have an eye for detail and order, being able to spot problems in code or data which others might miss or take longer to find.
You have a desire to explore and test concepts, ideas and theories.
About the company
Our vision is to transform the world’s most valuable asset class. By making it faster, easier and more efficient for property professionals to determine where, when and what to build. Using our big data analytics platform, users can save 90% of the time they previously spent on the typical appraisal or investment selection process. This, in turn, can ensure that property companies can increase returns and reduce their risks and costs. REalyse has been recognised as one of the leading property technology companies in the UK and globally and works with a range of real estate companies across development, lending, consulting and investment. We believe that real estate is fundamentally connected to almost everything, and that better data leads to better decisions and ultimately happier people.
The Interface
There’s a lot to do and our product continues to expand and develop. Over the next year we aim to build out three new product lines, each bringing new capabilities to the market. Work will start with implementing initial designs from the design team, followed by testing, improvements and finally release. On release we rapidly iterate the product from client feedback and so anyone joining the team will get to create and deploy code into production, often on the same day.
The Role
The main focus is around the data but keeping an eye on the whole product requirements with no defined boundaries. The current data processing has been mainly written in SQL using PostgreSQL and PostGIS and it runs on top of AWS/RDS/Data-Pipeline. Good SQL skills are required and knowledge of window functions, optimizing queries, spatial queries, GIS, data wrangling are a must. It is not a TELCO environment with crazy real time writes, but data aggregation. Also as we are in the process of ingesting more and more Machine Learning processing, we may need to make the whole pipeline flexible and that is why Scala/Python/Spark experience is required too
Technology we use:
We are open to people from a diverse range of backgrounds and would have a preference for people with an understanding of most of the following (not all essential as we’re happy for you to learn aspects as you go):
Postgres and PostGIS;
AWS/S3/RDS/EC2/Data-Pipeline;
Spark;
Java/Scala or similar;
Python for scripting;
Docker.
We are looking for someone with a good level of experience who will be comfortable to grow with the role and take on more responsibility as the team expands. We are still a small team, so you must be comfortable with conversing across all aspects of development and reacting quickly to new information.

causaLens is pioneering a completely new approach to time-series prediction. Its Enterprise Platform is used to transform and optimise businesses that need accurate and robust predictions – including significant businesses in finance, IoT, energy and telecoms. Almost all current machine learning approaches, including AutoML solutions, severely overfit on time-series problems and therefore fail to unlock the true potential of AI for the enterprise. causaLens was founded with the mission to devise Causal AI, which does not overfit, and so provides far more reliable and accurate predictions. The platform also includes capabilities such as autonomous data cleaning and searching, autonomous model discovery and end-to-end streaming productisation.
causaLens is on a mission to build truly intelligent machines that go beyond current machine learning approaches - a curve-fitting exercise. Devising Causal AI has allowed us to teach machines cause and effect for the first time - a major step towards true AI.

672,Senior PHP Developer,Gear4music Tech,York YO26,NaN,"Who we are
Gear4music is the largest retailer of musical instruments and equipment in the UK. Launched in 2003 by Chief Executive Officer Andrew Wass, our sales have grown quickly from £12M to £110M in the past 6 years. We’re not stopping there - we grew by more than 40% during the final four months of 2018!
Who we really are
Here in our technical hub, we really care about people. We want you to grow and develop with us in a fully open and supportive environment. We want to hear your ideas and for you to be yourself in an atmosphere that encourages people’s individual personalities to shine.
We pride ourselves on having a real culture here at Gear4music, we’re not an agency, we’re in-house and offer something that’s more than a token couple of beanbags and a PS4 you don’t have time to play. From important things like having a mental health first aider, silly things like our #toast Slack channel, the occasional #movienights to the D&D club we didn’t even know we had!
We’re techy to the core, with hands-on technical management through to board level. We pride ourselves on our flat structure where our directors sit in with the teams and are only a shoulder tap away when you need them. We encourage honest code review feedback, even if you’re critiquing your boss. We host regular knowledge-sharing lunches and have an active tech share channel for news, updates and all the latest releases.
Who we’re not
We’re not the kind of people who’ll sell you a job based on gimmicks and recruiter-speak. We know you don’t want to hear how disruptive we are, how unique this opportunity is or how many boundaries we’re pushing.
We’re also not an agency. You’ll have a chance to do your best work here, in a team who recognise that quality matters. You won’t be asked to skip writing tests because the client hasn’t paid for it.
There is no need for you to bring your noise cancelling headphones to drown out the sound of the endless sales calls, because we have an open plan office where you’re only surrounded by like-minded developers.
We truly believe in a healthy work/life balance. Here, our flexible hours allow you to start at a time that suits you, and you’re more likely to be told to go home than to stay late. That means getting home in time to tuck the kids into bed at night or get to that gig you’ve been looking forward to for ages.
We might be a socially active bunch, but if something’s not your bag, there is no forced inclusion. So if those pints down the pub or board game themed socials don’t strike the right chord, you’ve got nothing to worry about.
What we do
Gear4music sell musical instruments and equipment online. Our range includes over 50,000 products from nearly 900 manufacturers. We sell to over 190 countries, across 20 multilingual websites, 9 different currencies, shipping with more than 15 couriers, from 3 hubs in the UK, Germany and Sweden.
Our in-house tech team build and support the completely custom-built platform we use to make all of that possible. The projects you’d work on might include new user-facing features on our website, tweaks to one of our batch order processing systems, a large-scale architecture rework or an integration with a new courier.
Who are you
You are a motivated, flexible and talented engineer who is excited about leading and developing others and enthusiastic about learning new things and challenging themselves. We have opportunities for developers at every level, from junior through to principal developers and technical architects.
You’re not a lone ranger but believe in a joined up and friendly work environment that delivers real projects. You’re someone who takes pride in the things you do and likes to see things from beginning to end. You love the attention to detail and might even say it could be a strength and a weakness. You will champion new technologies when it’s right for the business.
You’ll also need some personality. You’ll get bonus points if you’ve got strong GIF-game, and we’d love to know what you’re into (even if you’re really passionate about a specific brand of water.) We want to hear all your ideas and we want you to tell us what you think.
What we’re looking for
We want to work with like-minded people who set high standards for themselves and the work that they produce. We’d love it if you were passionate about continuous integration, profiling, unit testing or documentation (or all of the above.)
Some of the skills and experience we’re looking for include:
A solid understanding of object-oriented PHP, design patterns, etc.
Interface development with HTML5, SCSS, JavaScript (including frameworks like ReactJS, Bootstrap, jQuery, ExtJS).
Strong MySQL knowledge, working with large & complex schemas.
Production experience with Linux environments, and experience with cloud computing.
Experience building highly scalable and complex distributed systems.
A background in commercial development, most likely on E-Commerce or high volume transactional systems.
An interest in web software performance (from micro-optimisations in PHP code, MySQL schemas and queries through to progressive web.)
Knowledge of or experience with any or all of these technologies: Composer, ElasticSearch, Docker, Ansible, Github, Continuous Integration, PHPUnit, Kubernetes, GCP, xhprof.
Don’t worry if you can’t tick all of these boxes! If you did, you might be exaggerating. We’d like to hear from you if this sounds like the kind of tech stack you’re used to working with.
What we can give you
Other than the benefit of working with such a great bunch of people, we also really value your wellbeing and want to ensure you have a lifestyle that helps you get the best of your work and your free time.

673,Senior Software Engineer,Agrimetrics,Harpenden,NaN,"CAREERS
Senior Software Engineer
Reading or Harpenden · Full Time
Role Description and Person Specification:
As a Senior Software Engineer, reporting to a Development Team Leader, you will join a team that comes from a wide range of industries and technology environments. Drawing upon these diverse experiences, you will envision and create our innovative Data Marketplace and new data-driven products and services that leverage shared and linked data.
About Agrimetrics
Mission
Agrimetrics is funded by UK Government to catalyse the whole UK agrifood industry through the power of big data and advanced analytics.

The agrifood sector faces critical challenges: how do farmers sustainably intensify agricultural production to produce more from less; and how do all players manage risk and build resilience in increasingly fragile, international supply chains?

Whilst the industry collects plenty of data, these datasets are often not electronic or are trapped in siloes within disjointed research, corporate or farm management databases. The sector remains very immature in deriving valuable insights through sharing and integrating data and using machine learning applied across large quantities of data for modelling and predictive analytics.
Products, services and customers
Agrimetrics is creating the world's first Data Marketplace for the agrifood sector. This is underpinned by a knowledge graph linking open and private data relevant to farming. Our first product set – Field Explorer – links these data to field polygons that were developed by applying AI algorithms to earth observation (EO)/satellite data.

Customers include:


Third party application developers like Glas Data, who connect with the Data Marketplace through REST and GraphQL APIs and can build their own farmer-facing applications using our trusted data.
Corporate data scientists like Barfoots, who can use our data in combination with their own data from farming operations within analytics that answer key business questions, like predicting when a crop will be ready for harvest.
Academics and researchers like the pan-Europe SmartCow programme, who collaborate around shared and linked data resources to improve reusability and repurposing of research data.

Future data products and services will allow different types of companies across the agrifood supply chain (agri-supply/agri-techs, agronomists, farmers, processors, distributors, retailers) to explore more data, examine data flexibly through different concepts and lenses, and use our Data Marketplace as the go-to resource for exposing their own data and models for exploitation across the market.
Funding
Agrimetrics operates as a start-up – the vast majority of our development and data science efforts are novel and qualify for R&D tax credits. But we are not beholden to fickle investment funding rounds, and Agrimetrics has a clear runway based on grant funding agreements from Innovate UK [1] . Agrimetrics is structured as a ""private company limited by guarantee without share capital"", so does not answer to shareholders.

[1] Along with our sister Agri-Tech Centres: Agri-EPI, CHAP and CIEL (www.agritechcentres.com)
Locations
We are located at Rothamsted Campus in Harpenden, Herts, AL5 2JQ and at the Reading Enterprise Centre in Reading, Berks, RG6 6BU. Roles are based at either location.

722,Back-end developer,Octopus Energy,London,NaN,"Octopus Energy is a tech-focused energy supplier for the UK market and we’re are looking for diligent and thoughtful software engineers, of any level of experience, to join our growing team.
We're building ""Kraken"", a cloud-based energy platform for interacting with both consumers (via the web, mobile and smart-meters) and the industry (eg data flows, consumption forecasting, trading on the wholesale market).
Unlike our competitors, we're a tech-led company. We aim to use first-class software engineering and creative technology to innovate and provide industry-beating customer service.
For evidence of innovation, see our Agile Octopus tariff (the world's first half-hourly tariff)
https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/feb/22/energy-company-promises-to-pay-customer-to-use-electricity
https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/08/octopus-energy-tariff-customers-see-profit-margins-gas-electricity
As for customer service, see our Trustpilot reviews.
This is a rare opportunity to use technology to help fight climate change through helping the UK to use green technology and renewable energy sources.
Our team
All technology is written and maintained by a multi-discipline engineering team of around twenty people. This includes server-side, client-side and mobile engineers working closely with UX experts, copywriters and designers.
We follow a Kanban-like approach, using Google docs and Trello to specify and manage work; Github, CircleCI and Terraform Enterprise as part of an immutable-infrastructure, continuous delivery pipeline; and Loggly, Sentry and Cloudwatch to measure performance and monitor production.
Engineering standards are high. We pair program, thoroughly review and test code before it deploys, and maintain fast, high-value test suites. We have weekly tech talks, monthly blitz-days (eg sharpening our internal tools, upgrading dependencies) and can often be found at tech meet-ups and conferences.
Our coding conventions are open-source and we maintain a tech blog.
Octopus is a great place to learn, work with some talented engineers and level-up your skills.
Our technology
On the server-side, we mainly use Python. Most of our websites are powered by Django and the Django-REST-framework. We also use Pandas, Numpy and Jupyter for analysis and forecasting, plus Celery, RabbitMQ, SQS and Airflow for background processing.
We use AWS heavily, employing most of the ""Hashistack"" (eg Packer, Consul, Terraform) as part of a continuous deployment pipeline. See, for example, Django, ELB health checks and continuous delivery.
Client-side, we use React, Redux and SASS; our mobile apps are built using React Native.
Why you should work for us
This is a great opportunity for several reasons:
We have lots of difficult design challenges to solve. The UK energy market is complicated, outdated and process-heavy - there's an awful lot of domain modelling that we need to get right. Strong attention to detail is essential.
We have difficult technical problems to solve. With the advent of smart meters, we'll soon be processing millions of meter readings a day. We need the right technology in place to handle this smoothly as well as feeding data into a machine learning pipeline that models and predicts consumption.
There's a great opportunity for disruption in the UK energy market. The big suppliers still dominate, but are not exactly popular. The energy landscape is changing as we move to more dis-aggregated forms of generation, with less predictability, more dynamism and smarter technology. Octopus Energy were the first UK supplier to introduce a ""tracker"" tariff whose prices track the daily wholesale prices: http://www.cleanenergynews.co.uk/news/efficiency/octopus-offers-transparency-with-wholesale-price-tariff
You'll be working for a company that’s fighting climate change. Our parent company is the largest investor in solar generation in the UK, and are funding wind and anaerobic digestion. As a supplier, we're helping people to use greener technology and renewable energy, all helping move the UK towards a lower carbon future.
What we're looking for
We're looking for someone with a general interest in technology and problem-solving; someone diligent and thoughtful. It would be helpful to have experience/expertise in the following (in rough priority order):
Python
Django (or equiv. web framework)
Domain modelling
HTTP and REST APIs
Writing robust and fault-tolerant software
Celery and async processing
Postgres
Plus experience in the following would be a bonus:
AWS
Terraform, Packer, Consul
React and Redux
We would prefer someone who can work in our Soho office but will consider remote candidates (warning: the bar is much higher). You do need to be able to work in the UK without a VISA though.
Above all, we’re looking for someone who thrives on providing alternative opinions, challenging those around them and being challenged.

It's been going well, too. Since launching in 2009, we've become one of the UK's fastest growing target audience companies, consistently renewing over 98% of our client base and doubling in size and revenue year-on-year. Our survey now represents more than 2 billion connected consumers, creating over 40,000 data points for clients including Twitter, Google, Spotify, WPP and Omnicom Group.

About diversity and inclusion
Imagine if our data came from just one kind of person. We'd get a very nuanced view of the world. And we definitely wouldn't have got off the ground as a business. We're so lucky to live in a society where differences are celebrated – so we'd expect nothing else from our teams. In fact, the GWI office is as diverse as our global data, and it's really important to us that it stays that way.

Building a start up from scratch is exciting. But terrifying.

The vision is there, but lack of funds, tiny teams of engineers all with ridiculous workloads, the pressure of not yet making any revenue all makes it difficult. The inability to do anything, or actually get any products to market, or having a VC peering over your shoulder all add to the risk.

Building that same start up however, funded by an established organisation, alleviates all those concerns.

Sitting as effectively an incubator within a global cash rich company means you can adopt that vital technology, you can hire that great Engineer you've interviewed, you can get a great product to market quickly without needing to cut corners. You have all the tools and funds at your disposal to ensure great products are built quickly, marketed well and you can see the fruits of your hard labour.

We have an opportunity to work with a genuine market leader, building a start up within (fully autonomous) to begin their next phase of market domination. Revolution and Disruption may be applicable terms.

We're looking for someone who can combine hands on technical experience with Cloud, DevOps, Data Analytics and Machine Learning along with the ability to manage and motivate (and hire) a talented team of Engineers. Currently sitting at 1 DevOp, 2 Data Engineers and 2 Software Engineers.

Terms that will excite you are Infrastructure as Code, Containerisation, Cloud, Data Science, Machine Learning. You will have experience either in Data or DevOps from a hands on perspective and the role will give you opportunity to get exposure to their other.

746,Senior DevOps Platform Engineer,Gear4Music,Manchester M1,NaN,"Who are we
Gear4music is the largest retailer of musical instruments and equipment in the UK. Launched in 2003 by Chief Executive Officer Andrew Wass, our sales have grown quickly from £12M to 110M in the past 6 years. We’re not stopping there - we grew by more than 40% during the final four months of 2018!
Who we really are
Here in our technical hub, we really care about people. We want you to grow and develop with us in a fully open and supportive environment. We want to hear your ideas and for you to be yourself in an atmosphere that encourages people’s individual personalities to shine.

We pride ourselves on having a real culture here at Gear4music, we’re not an agency, we’re in-house and offer something that’s more than a token couple of beanbags and a PS4 you don’t have time to play. From important things like having a mental health first aider, silly things like our #toast Slack channel, the occasional #movienights to the D&D club we didn’t even know we had!

We’re techy to the core, with hands-on technical management through to board level. We pride ourselves on our flat structure where our directors sit in with the teams and are only a shoulder tap away when you need them. We encourage honest peer review feedback, even if you’re critiquing your boss. We host regular knowledge-sharing lunches and have an active tech share channel for news, updates and all the latest releases.
Who we're not
We’re not the kind of people who’ll sell you a job based on gimmicks and recruiter-speak. We know you don’t want to hear how disruptive we are, how unique this opportunity is or how many boundaries we’re pushing.
We’re also not an agency. You’ll have a chance to do your best work here, in a team who recognise that quality matters. You won’t be asked to rush work through because the client hasn’t paid for it to be done properly.
There is no need for you to bring your noise cancelling headphones to drown out the sound of the endless sales calls, because we have an open plan office where you’re only surrounded by like-minded individuals.
We truly believe in a healthy work/life balance. Here, our flexible hours allow you to start at a time that suits you, and you’re more likely to be told to go home than to stay late. That means getting home in time to tuck the kids into bed at night or get to that gig you’ve been looking forward to for ages.
We might be a socially active bunch, but if something’s not your bag, there is no forced inclusion. So if those pints down the pub or board game themed socials don’t strike the right chord, you’ve got nothing to worry about.
What we do
Gear4music sell musical instruments and equipment online. Our range includes over 50,000 products from nearly 900 manufacturers. We sell to over 190 countries, across 20 multilingual websites, 9 different currencies, shipping with more than 15 couriers, from 3 hubs in the UK, Germany and Sweden.

Our in-house tech team build and support the completely custom-built platform we use to make all of that possible. The projects you’d work on might include new user-facing features on our website, tweaks to one of our batch order processing systems, a large-scale architecture rework or an integration with a new courier.
Who are you
We’re looking for great DevOps Engineers, who is excited about working in a collaborative environment. You are a motivated, flexible and talented engineer who is enthusiastic about learning new things and challenging themselves.

You’re not a lone ranger but believe in a joined up and friendly work environment that delivers real projects. You’re someone who takes pride in the things you do and likes to see things from beginning to end. You love the attention to detail and might even say it could be a strength and a weakness. You will champion new technologies when it’s right for the business.

You’ll also need some personality. You’ll get bonus points if you’ve got strong GIF-game, and we’d love to know what you’re into (even if you’re really passionate about a specific brand of water.) We want to hear all your ideas and we want you to tell us what you think.
What we’re looking for
You'll be working with our software engineering, architecture and testing teams to create a stable platform, enabling:
Scalable and resilient applications
Effective software development
Safe, easy & reliable releases (working towards CI/CD)
Testing, QA

We want to work with like-minded people who set high standards for themselves and the work that they produce. We’d love it if you were passionate about continuous integration, profiling, unit testing or documentation (or all of the above.)

You'll need to be comfortable working with:
Being capable of planning and managing your workload to suit multiple project deadlines.
Collaborate and share knowledge with other team members.
Cloud-based Linux environments: Google Cloud Platform, some AWS
Containerisation & Virtualisation: Docker, Kubernetes, AppEngine
Scalable and complex distributed systems

What we can give you
Other than the benefit of working with such a great bunch of people, we also really value your wellbeing and want to ensure you have a lifestyle that helps you get the best of your work and your free time.

The Company
causaLens is pioneering a completely new approach to time-series prediction. Its Enterprise Platform is used to transform and optimise businesses that need accurate and robust predictions – including significant businesses in finance, IoT, energy and telecoms. Almost all current machine learning approaches, including AutoML solutions, severely overfit on time-series problems and therefore fail to unlock the true potential of AI for the enterprise. causaLens was founded with the mission to devise Causal AI, which does not overfit, and so provides far more reliable and accurate predictions. The platform also includes capabilities such as autonomous data cleaning and searching, autonomous model discovery and end-to-end streaming productisation.

causaLens is on a mission to build truly intelligent machines that go beyond current machine learning approaches - a curve-fitting exercise. Devising Causal AI has allowed us to teach machines cause and effect for the first time - a major step towards true AI.

causaLens is run by scientists and engineers, the majority holding a PhD in a quantitative field. For more information visit www.causaLens.com or contact us on info@causaLens.com. Follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter.

764,Senior Backend Engineer (Python),Cambridge Spark,London,NaN,"(London)

Cambridge Spark’s mission is to help organisations develop the Data Science & AI capabilities of their workforce. Our tech team is part of a dedicated group focused on developing EDUKATE.AI, a learning management system (LMS) that enables training providers (universities and companies) to create interactive learning experiences that adapt to the capabilities of learners. On EDUKATE.AI learners solve problems in a simulated professional environment and receive instant personalised feedback.

The platform brings together research in software engineering, source code analysis, education pedagogy and machine learning.

EDUKATE.AI is currently used by various universities and large companies to deliver Data Science and Data Analysis programmes. It was also central to a research project with the University of Cambridge on recommender systems applied to education, thanks to a £1.4m government innovation funding provided by InnovateUK.

We're looking for a Senior Backend Engineer experienced with developing Python based applications and APIs.

Responsibilities :
This is an exciting role as we are a small, fast-paced team. Our backend is made of multiple APIs, a data pipeline processing students’ data to be used by our recommendation algorithms as well as an infrastructure based on Docker to run code submitted by users in the cloud and generate feedback. We need to scale this infrastructure so it can automatically respond to a higher number of users submitting at the same time, and decrease latency. The feedback generation currently takes a submission as input and takes a few seconds to run tests and benchmark the code. We are also building a fully interactive mode that will allow users to prototype their code directly in the browser, here the latency needs to be minimal to compete with a local development environment.

Key skills:
Strong Python skills are a must
Experience with GCP products (or equivalent): regular instances, cloud functions, cloud storage, etc..
Experience with Docker
Experience with software development tools and processes (version control, CI/CD, DevOps, etc...)
Experience building applications at scale: infrastructure, profiling, monitoring, performance, database indexing
Bonus skills:
Experience with a Python web framework (Flask, Django, etc..)
Experience with Java
Some familiarity with the Python Data Science stack (Pandas, Sklearn, Numpy, etc..)
Experience in teaching
